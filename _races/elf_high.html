description: Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests ar in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves lave nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world. As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
