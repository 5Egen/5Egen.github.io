description: Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs - these common threads unite all dwarves. As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain.
