description: Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests ar in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves lave nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world. Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth.
