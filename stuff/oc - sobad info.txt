Sobad grew up with a great love of nature. Her father, a wood elf, taught her everything he knew starting from a young age. She learned to gather, track, hunt, and survive in the wild. Her mother, a human, would sell the furs and other goods her father retrieved from the forest. From her mother she learned how to work with people, buying, selling, and trading. At around 9 or 10 her parents settled down in a small village and had several more children. As she got older, Sobad continued to help support her family and worked with her father more and more in the bordering forest. It wasn't long before her skills surpassed even those of her father. She was content to live in the village with her family, but her parents knew she had greater potential. Finally at their insistence, Sobad left to travel and see more of the world. Not long after leaving she met her first traveling companion; a young badger injured by a hunter's trap. 

The mom friend. Is calm and collected when necessary for others but can freak out about her own problems. Never burdens anyone else with what she's dealing with but is there for others to confide in.
